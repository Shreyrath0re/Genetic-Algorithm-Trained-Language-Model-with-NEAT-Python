# 🧬 Genetic Algorithm-Trained Language Model with NEAT-Python  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **language model trained using Genetic Algorithms (GA) and NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** to optimize neural network architectures for text processing. By leveraging **evolutionary computing**, the model dynamically evolves its structure and parameters to improve language understanding and generation.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Neuroevolution with NEAT** – Uses **NEAT-Python** to evolve neural network architectures for NLP tasks.  
- **Genetic Algorithm-Based Training** – Optimizes model weights and structures through evolutionary techniques.  
- **Text Processing & Language Generation** – Trains on datasets for improved natural language understanding.  
- **Adaptive Network Growth** – Expands or modifies network topology based on performance metrics.  
- **Python-Based Implementation** – Built using **NEAT-Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and NLP libraries**.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:**  
  - NEAT-Python (Neuroevolution)  
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch (Neural Network Implementation)  
  - NLTK / SpaCy (Natural Language Processing)  
  - NumPy & Pandas (Data Processing)  
  - Matplotlib (Visualization of Evolutionary Progress)
