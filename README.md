The objective of the project is to develop an application that applies genetic algorithms to optimize a model for text dataset processing. Specifically, the application will aim to use genetic algorithms to optimize parameters or features of a machine learning model for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or text generation.
Dataset taken: 30 random Tweets from Twitter.
